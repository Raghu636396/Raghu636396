### 🌐 About Me
I’m a dedicated *Network Engineer* passionate about enterprise-level routing, switching, and network design.  
I enjoy creating complex topologies, optimizing routing protocols, and ensuring network reliability.

I believe in continuous learning — I’ve completed my *CCNA, I’m pursuing **CCNP Switching & Routing*,  
and I plan to advance toward *CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure* certification.
